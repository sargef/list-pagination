2. Use unobtrusive JavaScript to append HTML for a search bar.
3. Pagination links are created. If there are 44 students, 5 links should be generated, if there’s 66 students, 7 links should be generated. Etc. 
4. The first 10 students are shown when the page loads, and each pagination link displays the correct students.
5. When a search yields 0 results, a message is displayed on the page, informing the user that no results have been found.
6. Clicking on “1” in the pagination links should show students 1 to 10. Clicking “2” shows 11 to 20. Clicking “5” shows students 41 to 50, and so on.
